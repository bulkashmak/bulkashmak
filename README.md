# Hi there! 😶‍🌫️

- 👨‍💻 I'm working as a QA automation engineer at Uzum Technologies. [Uzum](https://uzum.com/) is the biggest IT company in Uzbekistan which's building an ecosystem of Fintech, Marketplace, Foodtech and many other products that are yet to come.
- ❤️‍🔥 My passion is game development. By the end of 2022 I decided to enroll on a few Unity game dev courses on Udemy. Later I decided that I wanna dive into graphics programming and started learning C/C++ and OpenGL. So far it's going smoothly and I'm working to one day become a part of an amazing game dev community.
- 🤝 I'm open to new connections and building new relationships in Game dev and IT in general.
- 👻 If you need any help with QA/QA automation, feel free to ask me on Discord or Telegram.
